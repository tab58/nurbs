# nurbs
Javascript functions to handle non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS).

## WARNING - HEAVY DEVELOPMENT

The functions are going through some major changes, particularly library structure and required inputs. Things will break, so try not to depend too heavily on them until the v1.0 release.
